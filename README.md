# AI-based Internship Recommendation Engine (PM Internship Scheme)

🚀 **About the Project**
This is a lightweight AI-based recommendation system designed for the **PM Internship Scheme**, which suggests the **top 3–5 most relevant internships** to students based on their **skills, education, interests, and location preferences**.

The system is built keeping in mind:

* First-generation learners
* Students from rural/tribal/remote areas
* Users with **low digital literacy**
* Mobile-first accessibility with **regional language support**

---

## 🌟 Features

* **Personalized Recommendations** → Top 3–5 internships only (not overwhelming).
* **Lightweight AI Model** → Uses TF-IDF + rule-based filtering.
* **Multi-language Support** → Accessible in regional Indian languages.
* **Mobile-friendly UI** → Internship cards with clear details & icons.
* **Offline Mode (Prototype)** → Internship data can be cached for low-network areas.
* **Explainable AI** → Each suggestion shows *“Why suggested for you”*.
